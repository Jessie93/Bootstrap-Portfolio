# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Bootstrap portfolio for Jessica Stephenson


# Description
Description
This portfolio website showcases the works and skills of Jessica Stephenson, a Junior Front-End Web Developer. It was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap. The website features a navigation bar and menu at the top, links to navigate to different sections, a hero section, jumbotron with a picture, name, and information about the developer, a work section displaying projects in a grid using bootstrap cards, a skills section, an about me section, and a footer. The website is responsive and was designed to minimize the use of media queries.

With more time I would like to update my portfolio to show not only that I am a web developer but I also have a background in UX/UI and Graphic Design. 
> **Note**: please see roadmap section

> **Note**: All projects within this portfolio are placeholders except the Horiseon code refactor project. All placeholder projects will link to the Horiseon code refactor project page.

 This layout has been designed for viewing on a slightly smaller screen that the screenshot above, so you may notice that some of the elements have been changed to fit a resolution. These include but not limited to the navigation bar and the way the projects are now displayed.

The profile picture will be removed and added to the about me section. The updates are still ongoing and a link to the deployed site will be provided once completed.

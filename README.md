# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Bootstrap portfolio for Jessica Stephenson


# Description
Portfolio for Jessica Stephenson - Junior Front-End Web Developer.
Recreate my personal portfolio using as much Bootstrap as possible to showcase my up and coming projects. 

I have chosen to use my own placeholder images as these are more visually appealing. With more time I would like to update my portfolio to show not only that I am a web developer but I also have a background in UX/UI and Graphic Design. 
> **Note**: please see roadmap section

> **Note**: All projects within this portfolio are placeholders except the Horiseon code refactor project. All placeholder projects will link to the Horiseon code refactor project page.

# Criteria

Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:
The website should include the following bootstrap components:

* A Navigation bar and a navigation menu at the top.
* Include links that are applicable to your portfolio. Links should navigate to the appropriate sections
* A hero section
* A jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include.
* A work section that displays your work in grid.
* Use bootstrap cards for each project.The description should give a brief overview of the work.
* A skills section
* An "About Me" section 
* A footer section.
* All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.

 This layout has been designed for viewing on a slightly smaller screen that the screenshot above, so you may notice that some of the elements have been changed to fit a resolution. These include but not limited to the navigation bar and the way the projects are now displayed.

# Roadmap

I would like to incorporate my UX/UI and Graphic Design working into my portfolio to show that I also 8+ years working in the design field. 

I would like to remove the profile picture and stick it in the ‘about me section’ Please view the gif attached. These updates are not complete but when they are I will add a link to my deployed site.
